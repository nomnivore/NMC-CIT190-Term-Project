== Overview ==

The Arkade is a HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/JQuery project where the objective is to create
3 games using JQuery and HTML5 Canvas. It was made for the CIT190 Term Project at NMC.

The audience of the project is fans of word and logic style games.
The layout is a Multi "Page" Scroll - each page is at least as tall as the viewport.
Individual pages use a variety of flexbox and grid layout based on their needs.
The color scheme is a dark theme with neon-style highlights in a square harmony relation.

Each game is contained within its own folder. Each game folder contains all necessary
HTML, CSS, and JS files to function. The games also inherit styles from the base stylesheet,
located in the project's root css folder. Games WILL have individual CSS and JS files 
in each folder containing all their necessary styles and scripts to run the games.
